    <h1>Toponomy of Barcelona</h1>
    <p>The origin of the "Barcelona" name is unkown and multiple theories and legends try to explain it. As far as known, there was an original iberic city ocuped by the layetans tribu. Subsequently it was conquered by Cneo Cornelio Escipión Calvo and later it was converted in a roman colony protected by Cayo Julio César and Octavio Augusto. Its name evolved during the middle ages passing by names like Barchinona, Barcalona, Barchelona and Barchenona
        <br><br>
        One of the legends about the origin of Barcelona aludes to an hipotetic fundation by the carthaginian general Amícar Barca after conquering the iberian key after his arrive in Iberia. There are other stories that atributte this to his son Aníbal, who ocupated the territory during the second punic war in his way to the Pirineos. Nevertheless, any prove or documentary does exist to confirm this connection between the Barca family and the city today known as Barcelona.

        Another legend does exist giving the city name a mitological explanation. In this legend, Hercules joined the argonauts after finishing his fourth job to help them find the Gold Vellonicio, but while travelling close to the catalan coast a big torment separated the boats that were on the expedition, making the ninth boat dissapear. After this Hercules started looking for it and the found the shipwreck rests of this ninth boat called Barca Nona next to the actual Montjuic. The tripulants found the place so peacfull and beautiful that decided to creato a cuty there, calling it Barcanona.
